      What's more fun than a day of talking tech? A night of hacking tech!

      We love what Yahoo!'s done with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_Day">Open Hack Day</a>,
      so we're going to have something like it alongside our events starting with JSFoo.

      To get an idea of what JSFoo hacknight is supposed to be like, have a glimpse of the <a href="/bangalore2011/hacknight">hacknight videos from JSFoo Bangalore</a> and the 
      <a href="/pune2012/hacknight"> hacknight videos from JSFoo Pune</a>
