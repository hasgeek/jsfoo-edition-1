    Dharmaram Vidya Kshetram was a hit at
    <a href="http://phpcloud.hasgeek.com">Scaling PHP in the Cloud</a>, so we are back at the
    same venue for jsFoo. This time we are using the inner rooms and skipping the main hall,
    which had an echo problem.
    </p>
    <p>
    To get there, enter Christ Universityâ€™s main entrance gate (the one on the right) and
    drive straight down to Dharmaram Vidya Kshetram, then turn right and go around the building
    to the rear. Christ University is at Dairy Circle, half a kilometre from the Forum Mall.
