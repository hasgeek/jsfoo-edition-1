      jsFoo is a one day conference on building full size apps in JavaScript. 
      Come over for a full day with the smartest geeks from across India who have figured it out and will show you how. 
      We have sessions covering the range from pure JavaScript apps in Node.js to real-time 
      streaming of data to building entirely in the client side with Backbone.js.

      This is an event for serious JavaScript programmers who want to learn from their peers.
